# Kets with Neural Networks

This project explores the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning by integrating quantum **kets** with **neural networks**. The aim is to simulate or enhance quantum systems using modern AI techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Representation of quantum states using kets
- Neural network models to approximate or evolve quantum states
- Experiments with hybrid quantum-classical computation

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- PyTorch / TensorFlow *(depending on what you use)*
- Qiskit / PennyLane *(if using quantum libraries)*
